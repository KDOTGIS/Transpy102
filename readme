EXOR TO ESRI 
This project contains python scripts to extract GIS data from EXOR Highways 4.4.?? using Exor Spatial
Manager in ArcGIS 9.1, along with an oracle View or Materialized View of the Unique, Primary Routes with 
GIS-LRS KEY, EXOR ROUTE GROUP KEY, and begin/end mile fields.  

CANSYS - These scripts operate in the ArcPY modules of ArcGIS 10.1 or 10.2.  
	Main - this is the main script to create the GIS networks
		ENV -  this is the variables/classes for the processing environment
		LRS_CRND_SRND - calibrates the GIS Network Routes to match Measures from EXOR using calibration points
		LRS_PRECISION_SDO - calibrates the GIS network routes ot match measures for Geomedia, wich does not recognize/interpolate measures
		LRS_VIDEOLOG - calibrates the Videolog Lane GPS traces to the County Mile Calibration Points to match 
	ITEMS - processes the ITEMS from EXOR into ESRI feature classes
		DOMAINS - converts EXOR domains to ESRI Geodatabase domains
	DISTRIBUTE - Copies the extracted, transformed files and loads them into dev, test, or production data environments
	
CANSYS 9.1 - this script runs through a toolbox in ArcGIS 9.1 EXOR Spatial Manager Extension
	an example ArcGIS 9.1 MXD is included.
